## Augmented Intelligence: Human-Machine Collaboration

Augmented Intelligence represents a collaborative approach where human intelligence works alongside machine intelligence. Rather than replacing human decision-making, this approach enhances it by combining human insight with computational power.

The concept is straightforward: humans excel at creative thinking and contextual understanding, while machines excel at processing large amounts of data quickly. Together, they can solve problems more effectively than either could alone.
