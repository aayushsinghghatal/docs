title: "Types of Artificial Intelligence"

Not all AI is created equal. To understand the landscape of AI, it helps to categorize it based on what it's capable of and how it functions. We can break this down into two main classification systems.

## Classification 1: Based on Capability (The "Power Level")

This is the most common way to think about AI, categorizing it by its level of intelligence, from highly specialized to vastly superhuman. Think of it like the evolution of a species or leveling up in a video game.

#### 1. Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI)

Also known as "Weak AI," this is the **only type of AI that exists today.**

- **What it is:** ANI is an AI that is specialized for **one specific task**. It can be incredibly powerful at that single task, often exceeding human ability, but it cannot operate outside of its narrow programming.
- **Think about:**
  - Your phone's facial recognition. It's brilliant at identifying your face but can't use that knowledge to drive a car.
  - A GPS navigation system. It's a genius at finding the best route but can't write an email.
  - **AlphaGo**, the AI that defeated the world's best Go player. It's the undisputed champion of Go, but you can't ask it for the weather forecast.

#### 2. Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)

Also known as "Strong AI" or "Human-Level AI," this is the next major milestone for the field.

- **What it is:** AGI is an AI with the ability to understand, learn, and apply its intelligence to solve **any problem a human being can.** It would possess abstract thinking, background knowledge, and common sense.
- **Think about:** This is the type of AI you see in science fiction, like Data from _Star Trek_ or the helpful droids in _Star Wars_. It's a machine with the generalized cognitive abilities of a human, not tied to a single task.
- **Current Status:** AGI does **not** yet exist. It is the primary goal for many AI researchers, but creating it is an incredibly complex challenge.

#### 3. Artificial Superintelligence (ASI)

This is the final, theoretical stage of AI development.

- **What it is:** ASI is an intellect that is much smarter than the best human minds in virtually every field, including scientific creativity, general wisdom, and social skills.
- **Think about:** An ASI wouldn't just be a faster thinker; it would be a _better_ thinker, capable of making discoveries and inventions far beyond our comprehension. Its rise would be one of the most transformative events in human history.
- **Current Status:** ASI is purely **hypothetical**.

## Classification 2: Based on Functionality (The "How it Thinks" Model)

This system categorizes AI based on its ability to perceive the world and use that information.

#### 1. Reactive Machines

This is the most basic form of AI.

- **How it works:** It perceives the world directly and acts on what it sees. It doesn't have a memory of the past, so it can't use past experiences to inform current decisions. It performs the same way every time it encounters the same situation.
- **Example:** **IBM's Deep Blue**, the chess computer that beat Garry Kasparov. Deep Blue could identify the pieces on the board and calculate the best possible move from all the options, but it didn't "remember" any moves from past games. Its strategy was purely based on the present moment.

#### 2. Limited Memory

This is where most of today's AI applications are.

- **How it works:** This AI can store past data and predictions for a short period. It uses this recent past to inform its decisions in the immediate future. The "memory" is not saved into a library of experiences that it can learn from later.
- **Example:** A **self-driving car**. It observes the speed and direction of other cars, reads lane markings, and tracks traffic lights. This information about the recent past is critical for deciding when to change lanes or brake. Once the car has moved on, that specific memory is no longer needed.

#### 3. Theory of Mind (Future Goal)

This is the next level of AI systems that researchers are working on.

- **How it would work:** This AI would have social intelligence. It could understand that people, creatures, and objects in the world have thoughts, feelings, and intentions that affect their own behavior.
- **Example:** A truly helpful home assistant robot would need to understand _why_ you're asking for something. It would need to interpret your tone of voice and facial expressions to grasp your emotional state and intentions.

#### 4. Self-Awareness (Hypothetical)

This is the final stage of AI development and the stuff of science fiction.

- **How it would work:** An AI that has achieved this stage would have its own consciousness, a sense of self, and an awareness of its own internal state. It would be a sentient being.
- **Example:** Fictional characters like Skynet from _The Terminator_ or HAL 9000 from _2001: A Space Odyssey_ represent this idea of a self-aware, conscious AI. This is a purely theoretical concept for now.
