title: "What is Machine Learning?"
---

In the previous module, we learned that Machine Learning (ML) is a _subset_ of Artificial Intelligence. It's not just a part of AI; it's the engine that powers most of the AI advancements we see today. So, what exactly is it?

### The Core Idea: Learning From Data

The traditional way to make a computer do something is to give it explicit, step-by-step instructions. This is called **explicit programming**. For example, to write a program that calculates a 10% discount, you would write a rule like this: `final_price = original_price * 0.90`. The program can't do anything else; it just follows the rule you wrote.

**Machine Learning flips this on its head.**

Instead of giving the computer rules, you give it **data**. The ML algorithm then processes this data and "learns" the patterns and rules on its own.

Arthur Samuel, an AI pioneer, defined it perfectly back in 1959: Machine Learning is the field of study that gives computers the ability to **learn without being explicitly programmed.**

**Analogy: Learning to Identify Animals**

- **Explicit Programming:** You could try to write a set of rules for a computer to identify a cat: "If it has pointy ears, AND whiskers, AND a long tail, AND fur... then it's a cat." This is brittle and will fail quickly. What about a cat with folded ears or no tail?
- **Machine Learning:** You show the computer **thousands of pictures labeled "cat"** and **thousands of pictures labeled "not a cat."** The algorithm analyzes all these examples and learns the underlying patterns of what makes a cat a cat on its own. After this "training," it can accurately identify cats in new pictures it has never seen before. It learned the "rules" from the data, rather than being handed them.

### The Typical Machine Learning Workflow

While there are many different types of ML models, most projects follow a similar high-level process. Understanding this workflow is key to understanding how ML is applied in the real world.
