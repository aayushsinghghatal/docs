title: "Computer Vision"
description: "Computer Vision is a field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that enables computers to see and understand images or videos, just like humans do."
---

The goal is to make machines **recognize, interpret, and react** to visual inputs — whether it's a photo of a cat, a live security camera feed, or a medical X-ray.

## Why is Computer Vision Important?

Humans rely heavily on vision to understand the world — identifying people, reading signs, recognizing objects, etc. Computer Vision allows machines to do the same, which is incredibly useful for:

- Automating tasks (like self-driving cars)
- Assisting doctors (like detecting tumors in scans)
- Improving security (like facial recognition)
- And much more\!

## How Does Computer Vision Work?

Computer Vision systems typically follow these steps:

1. **Input** – The system receives an image or video.
2. **Processing** – The computer breaks down the image into pixels and analyzes patterns like shapes, edges, or colors.
3. **Understanding** – Using AI models (like CNNs), it figures out what's in the image.
4. **Decision** – Based on the output, it performs an action or makes a prediction.
