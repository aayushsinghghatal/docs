title: "Convolutional Neural Networks"
description: "A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a type of deep learning model specially designed to process grid-like data, such as images. CNNs are the foundation of computer vision, used in tasks like image classification, facial recognition, object detection, and more."

## Why do we need CNN?

Let’s say you show a regular computer a photo. To it, it’s just **a bunch of numbers** (pixels). It doesn’t "see" the image like we do.

CNNs help computers **focus on important parts** of the image — like shapes, edges, or colors — and use that to figure out what’s in the picture.

## How Does a CNN Work?

Think of CNN as a machine with **layers** — like a sandwich. Each layer has a job.

### **Convolution Layer** (The "Eye")

This layer scans the image like your eyes scan a photo.\
It looks for **simple patterns** like:

- Edges
- Corners
- Lines

**Example**: It might notice the curve of a cat’s ear or the straight line of a table.

### **Pooling Layer** (The "Zoom Out")

This layer **shrinks** the image a little — keeping the important parts and ignoring the extra details.

Like zooming out to get the bigger picture, but still seeing the important stuff.

### **Fully Connected Layer** (The "Brain")

Now that the important features are found, this layer puts it all together to **decide what the image is**.

**For example**:

- “Hmm... pointy ears, whiskers, round eyes... I think it’s a cat\!”

## CNN in Action: Real Examples

| Task                        | CNN Helps With                       |
| :-------------------------- | :----------------------------------- |
| 📸 **Image classification** | Is this a dog or a cat?              |
| 😃 **Face recognition**     | Who is this? (used in Face ID)       |
| 🚗 **Object detection**     | Where’s the stop sign in this photo? |
| 🧠 **Medical scans**        | Spot tumors in X-rays or MRIs        |
| 🔍 **Security cameras**     | Detect unusual behavior or movement  |
