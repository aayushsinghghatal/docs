## Narrow AI: Task-Specific Intelligence

Narrow AI systems are designed to perform specific tasks well but cannot operate outside their trained functions.

**Characteristics:**

- Highly specialized for particular tasks
- Cannot adapt to new or different problems
- Most common type of AI in use today

**Common Examples:**

- Voice assistants like Siri or Alexa
- Navigation systems like Google Maps
- Image recognition in smartphones
- Recommendation algorithms on streaming platforms

## Broad AI: Multi-Task Intelligence

Broad AI represents a middle ground between narrow and general AI. These systems can handle multiple related tasks within a specific domain or industry.

**Key Features:**

- Can work across several related functions
- Requires domain-specific training data
- Often tailored for particular industries
- More versatile than Narrow AI but still limited in scope

**Applications:**

- Weather forecasting systems that predict multiple weather patterns
- Medical diagnostic tools that can identify various conditions
- Business analytics platforms that handle different types of market analysis

## General AI: Human-Level Intelligence

General AI would possess human-like cognitive abilities across all domains and tasks. This represents the theoretical goal of creating machines that can think, learn, and adapt like humans.

**Theoretical Capabilities:**

- Self-awareness and consciousness
- Ability to learn any new skill or task
- Creative and abstract thinking
- Emotional understanding

**Current Status:** General AI remains theoretical and has not been achieved. It represents an ongoing research goal rather than current reality.
