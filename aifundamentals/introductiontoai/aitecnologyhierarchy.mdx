## Artificial Intelligence (The Foundation)

AI serves as the umbrella term for all technologies that enable machines to simulate intelligent behavior.

## Machine Learning (The Learning Engine)

Machine Learning is a subset of AI that focuses on creating systems that can learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed for every scenario.

**How it Works:** Machine Learning algorithms analyze data to identify patterns and relationships. As they process more data, they become better at making accurate predictions or decisions. The principle is simple: more data typically leads to better performance.

## Deep Learning (The Pattern Recognition Specialist)

Deep Learning is a specialized branch of Machine Learning that uses neural networks with multiple layers to process information, loosely inspired by how the human brain processes information.

**Key Strengths:**

- Excels at recognizing complex patterns in large datasets
- Learns features automatically without manual programming
- Particularly effective for tasks involving images, speech, and language

**Primary Uses:**

- Image and video recognition
- Natural language processing
- Speech recognition and synthesis
