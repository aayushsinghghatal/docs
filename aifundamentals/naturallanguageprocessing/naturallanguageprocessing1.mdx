## Core Purpose

The primary purpose of NLP is to transform unstructured textual data into structured, actionable insights. It plays a vital role in enabling seamless human-computer interaction through natural language and in automating language-driven processes in business, healthcare, customer support, and more. NLP allows machines to extract key information, understand intent, analyze sentiment, and respond in ways that mimic human communication.

## Key NLP Concepts

### Text Processing Fundamentals

Before any advanced NLP task can be performed, text must be preprocessed and cleaned.

- **Sentence Segmentation**: The process of dividing text into individual sentences. This is an essential first step for tasks like summarization or sentiment analysis.
- **Tokenization**: Breaking a sentence or paragraph into individual units called _tokens_ (e.g., words, phrases, punctuation). Tokens serve as the base input for all downstream NLP tasks.
- **Text Normalization**: Standardizing the text by converting it to lowercase, removing punctuation, and correcting misspellings. This ensures consistency across data.
- **Language Detection**: Identifying the language of the input text to route it through the correct processing pipeline.
- **Encoding**: Converting text into numerical representations (e.g., word embeddings, one-hot vectors) so that machines can analyze and process it.
