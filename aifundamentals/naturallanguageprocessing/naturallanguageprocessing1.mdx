title: "Natural Language Processing"
description: "Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that focuses on enabling machines to understand, interpret, and generate human language. It bridges the gap between computers and human communication."

## Core Purpose

The primary purpose of NLP is to transform unstructured textual data into structured, actionable insights. It plays a vital role in enabling seamless human-computer interaction through natural language and in automating language-driven processes in business, healthcare, customer support, and more. NLP allows machines to extract key information, understand intent, analyze sentiment, and respond in ways that mimic human communication.

## Text Processing Fundamentals

Human language is full of **grammar rules**, **ambiguity**, and **context**. Computers need to **break it down into smaller parts** to process it meaningfully.

### Segmentation

Segmentation helps us **divide raw text into manageable pieces**.

#### Reasons:

- Helps detect where **one idea ends and another begins** (e.g., sentence boundaries).
- Essential for tasks like **translation, summarization, and voice recognition**.
- Makes **processing easier** by breaking long texts into smaller chunks.

#### Example:

Without segmentation:

> “Hi how are you I’m fine thanks”

With segmentation:

> [“Hi, how are you?”, “I’m fine, thanks.”]

### Tokens

#### Reasons:

- Words (tokens) are the **basic units of meaning** that NLP models work with.
- Helps in converting text into **numbers or vectors** (like in ML models).
- Needed for **search engines, chatbots, translations**, and more.

#### Example:

Without tokenization:

> “Iamhungry”

With tokenization:

> [“I”, “am”, “hungry”]

### Real Challenges in NLP Tokenization

- **Ambiguity**:
  - “Let’s eat, grandma\!” vs “Let’s eat grandma\!” → one punctuation changes everything.
- **Multi-word expressions**:
  - "New York" should be one token, not two separate words.
