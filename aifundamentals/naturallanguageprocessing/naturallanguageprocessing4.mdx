title: "Intent and Entity Recognition"
description: "When you talk to an AI-powered chatbot or voice assistant, the system has to figure out:

    What you want to do → This is your intent

    What details you gave to complete that action → These are entities

Together, these allow the chatbot to understand the meaning behind your message.

## Intent Recognition

**Intent recognition** is the process of identifying **the purpose or goal** of the user’s input. It tells the system _what action_ the user wants to perform.

#### Examples of Intents:

| User Input                  | Recognized Intent     |
| :-------------------------- | :-------------------- |
| "Book a flight to Mumbai"   | `book_flight`         |
| "What’s the weather today?" | `get_weather`         |
| "Set an alarm for 7 AM"     | `set_alarm`           |
| "Cancel my subscription"    | `cancel_subscription` |

## Entity Recognition

**Entity recognition** (also known as **Named Entity Recognition** or NER) is the process of extracting **important pieces of information** from the text that help complete the intent.

#### Examples of Entities:

| User Input                          | Entities Recognized                |
| :---------------------------------- | :--------------------------------- |
| "Book a flight to Mumbai on Sunday" | Location: `Mumbai`, Date: `Sunday` |
| "Set an alarm for 7 AM tomorrow"    | Time: `7 AM`, Date: `tomorrow`     |
| "Remind me to call John at 5 PM"    | Person: `John`, Time: `5 PM`       |

## How They Work Together

Here’s a combined example:

**User says**:

> “I want to book a flight from Delhi to Mumbai on Monday.”

| Component    | Result                                      |
| :----------- | :------------------------------------------ |
| **Intent**   | `book_flight`                               |
| **Entities** | `from: Delhi`, `to: Mumbai`, `date: Monday` |
