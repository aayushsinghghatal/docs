The goal is to classify the text into categories such as **positive**, **negative**, or **neutral**.

It is commonly used in analyzing:

- **Product reviews**
- **Social media posts**
- **Customer feedback**
- **News articles**

For example:

- “This laptop is fantastic\!” → **Positive sentiment**
- “The screen is okay, but the battery is terrible.” → **Mixed/Neutral**
- “Worst purchase I’ve ever made.” → **Negative sentiment**

This type of analysis helps companies and organizations gauge public opinion, improve products, and respond to customer concerns.
