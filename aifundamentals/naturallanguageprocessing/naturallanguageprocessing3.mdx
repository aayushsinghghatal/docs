description: "Emotion detection (or emotional classification) goes a step further by identifying specific emotions expressed in text."

Instead of general sentiment categories, emotion detection looks for labels like:

- Joy
- Sadness
- Anger
- Fear
- Disgust
- Surprise
- Love
- Trust

For instance:

- “I’m so excited about the trip\!” → Emotion: **Joy**
- “I feel really scared about the exam.” → Emotion: **Fear**
- “He lied to me again\!” → Emotion: **Anger**

Emotion detection is used in applications such as **mental health monitoring**, **empathetic chatbots**, **literary analysis**, and **emotional intelligence in AI** systems.
